# json_validation
This is a python script to validate JSON files against schemas.

How to make it work:
1) You need to have directory with JSON files only that you want to check
2) You need to have directory with JSON schemas that you want your files to check against
3) If you don't yet have jsonschema, install it with 'pip install jsonschema' command in your shell
4) Download validator.py script and run 'python validator.py' in your shell, it will ask you to provide absolute path to JSON files and JSON schemas
5) See results in log.txt and log_detailed.txt
